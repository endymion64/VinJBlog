<p>I know, I know&#8230;&#8203; It&#8217;s been a while. üòÖ My sincere apologies for being silent such a long time. As a matter of fact, I had lost my motivation to keep this blog alive, but my time in Japan is almost over, so let&#8217;s end it in beauty! There is still so much I could tell you all, so let&#8217;s try to get started again!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s my first blog post from 2017, so that means I still owe you all a Happy New Year, so&#8230;&#8203; Happy New Year everyone! <strong><em>&lt;insert party horn sound&gt;</em></strong> Now that the formalities are over, let&#8217;s get back to business and pick up where we ended: December 2016. It was, as usual, quite a busy month. The language course at the Naganuma School was about to end. As part of finalizing the course, we had to give a small presentation, in Japanese of course, about our studies and the coming internship. The school activities ended with a tears shedding graduation ceremony, followed by an even more emotional reception. The Vulcanus students spread their wings and settled across Japan to work in the research departments of famous Japanese multinationals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But before we jumped into work, it was time to enjoy a 3-week break. As to say, it was the longest break I will have had in Japan. Three whole weeks of pure freedom, so what did I do during that time? As you all might have thought, I enjoyed it by watching anime, reading manga, staying inside, playing videgames and avoiding sunlight as much as possible&#8230;&#8203; But since I&#8217;m used to do that in Belgium, I thought there could be some change for once. What I did instead was traveling to the most northern and southern part of Japan: Hokkaidou (ÂåóÊµ∑ÈÅì) and Okinawa (Ê≤ñÁ∏Ñ)!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since it&#8217;s been so long after the events, I forgot a lot of the details, but I&#8217;ll try somehow to make it an interesting story. This post will be about my time in Hokkaidou with Sa≈°o and Ole. The pictures I took during this trip can be retrieved in the following <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/oQP3i9gk4wTV9jop6"><strong>album</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="_day_1_sapporo">Day 1: Sapporo</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, the first impression I had when arriving in New Chitose airport could be transcribed as follows: <em>"Oh look, there&#8217;s some snow. That&#8217;s cool&#8230;&#8203; And look over there, there&#8217;s more snow&#8230;&#8203; &lt;dramatic pause&gt;&#8230;&#8203; HOLY SHIIIT, THERE&#8217;S A FUCKTON OF SNOW EVERYWHERE!!!"</em>.
It must have been since my ski trip to Austria back in elementary school that I had seen that much snow at once. Everything was white: rooftops, nature, sidewalks, roads&#8230;&#8203; Everything, everywhere was covered by a white blanket.
We took the train to Sapporo and stayed in an AirBNB near Hokkaidou University for 4 days. The first day, we visited Sapporo itself.
The roads in Sapporo were covered in ice, yet traffic seemed not to obstructed. What I did remark was that the roads in Sapporo were much wider than the roads I was used to in Tokyo and Kawasaki.
The city itself sure shows a lot of American influences! Logical though, since Sapporo was built with the help of the American government back in the 19th century! Some historical sites really have that "Wild West" atmosphere, such as the Sapporo Clocktower and the Red Government Building.
Besides the historical sites, we also visited the Sapporo TV Tower (imagine the little brother of Tokyo Tower) and drank some Gl√ºhwhein at the German Christmas market over there. ('t was the season to be jolly after all&#8230;&#8203;)
After going for one of Hokkaidou&#8217;s famous dishes (soup curry, „Çπ„Éº„Éó„Ç´„É¨„Éº) in a place called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298560-d3808559-Reviews-Soup_Curry_Samurai_Sakura-Sapporo_Hokkaido.html"><strong>Samurai Sakura</strong></a> (I highly recommend it!), we went out of the city and climbed up Mount Moiwa (ËóªÂ≤©Â±±) by cable lift and stayed there for sunset in order to see Sapporo lighting up.
To end the day, we went back to Odori Park, in front of the Sapporo TV Tower, and enjoyed the illuminations over there. For me it was a first time visiting illuminations in Japan and I must say I was impressed. Winter Wonderland with thousands of lights in several colors reflecting against the snowy background really gives a soothing feeling.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second day, we went skiing on Mount Teine, just outside of Sapporo. We had a bright sky that day. On the mountain, we had a great overview of Sapporo, and could even see the Japanese Sea (Ishikari Bay to be more precise).
The ski slopes were very nice! We mostly took the long track which was about 4 kilometers long. Of course, being as excited as I was, I was being a speed-devil from time to time, with the result I made some gracious face plants. Luckily I didn&#8217;t get any injuries or fractures!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the third day of <strike>Christmas</strike> the Hokkaidou trip, we visited the old harbor town, Otaru, which had a rather worn out impression to be honest. The architecture over there again showed a lot of Western influences.
The village itself was not as amusing as expected, it was rather focused on souvenirs. Most of the shops also sold the same type of articles: glass work, liquor, chocolates etc.
For lunch, we ate Genghis Khan („Ç∏„É≥„ÇÆ„Çπ„Ç´„É≥). Yup that&#8217;s right: we ate the Mongolian conqueror from the 12th and 13th century! He tasted like grilled mutton meat.
The most attracting site in Otaru is the canal and the lantern path over there, but we didn&#8217;t stay for the nightfall to see the lanterns lighting up.</p>

<p>Before checking-in at our hotel, we walked around a bit around the village. To our surprises, there is a bear park, but we didn&#8217;t enter it, since we weren&#8217;t that interested.
We walked by the village&#8217;s Geyser, which is sited underneath a traffic road, met The King of Hell in his temple: <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g325583-d6839624-Reviews-Enmado-Noboribetsu_Hokkaido.html"><strong>Enma-dou</strong></a>(ÈñªÈ≠îÂ†Ç), and walked to the Hell Valley (Âú∞ÁçÑË∞∑, jigokudani): the sulfurous, volcanic main source of Noboribetsu&#8217;s hot spring waters. The smell of sulfur hangs everywhere, but the view is majestic.</p>

<p>We stayed the night in a hotel with Japanese decorated rooms, which means we had to sleep in a futon on a tatami floor. We got a Yukata to walk around in the hotel and the onsen. It was very relaxing (apart from the majority of Chinese tourists during dinner who apparently don&#8217;t understand the purpose of queues at the buffet and are not ashamed of turning their tables into a dump&#8230;&#8203;).
After a good night&#8217;s rest and a final 6 A.M. morning dive in the onsen, we went back to New Chitose Airport and said goodbye to Japan&#8217;s Winter Wonderland of the North.</p>

<p>It has been a whole month since I made my last post.
Time just keeps flying&#8230;&#8203;
The final weeks at Naganuma School have started.
All of a sudden, I start to realize that the end of a hard, tough, but yet oh so fulfilling period in my lifetime is nearing.
Next week, I will have my final presentation, my graduation ceremony from Naganuma School.
I&#8217;ll have to prove to the outside world what 3 months of cramming words, verbs and grammar into your head can result in.
But I don&#8217;t have to do it alone, the presentations are done in groups of 2 people.
I was coupled to my buddy, Shaikh, from the Netherlands.
We are currently finishing our script and I can say to feel satisfied about the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What actually began as a blog post about an afternoon spent listening to two great bands, turned out into a compilation of what I have experienced through November since I haven&#8217;t written anything here for a while.
And since I had a rare free evening in the middle of a school week, I realised I could finally start to spit my gut properly.
So be prepared for a rather long story.
Grab you popcorn, fetch some coke, sit down and here we go!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me start by saying this: school was rather tough for me in November.
I think I started to get tired of continuously stuffing my head with new content every night.
From the moment I wake up, until the last second I fall asleep, my mind is trying to process new, freshly learnt Japanese.
We have come to a point that the number of words and verbs we have encountered are that numereous, you cannot use them anymore on a regular basis.
Result: you start to forget, you start to forget a lot!
The only manner to regain forgotten knowledge: review it.
The thing is, I don&#8217;t find the motivation to do this properly, since I already cram those daily 30 new words in my head and these words are at that point in time more important to me than the previous 628 (to give it a random number).
But I have let the frustration behind me and took peace with the fact that my brain cannot simply remember words that I only have encountered once on a piece of paper and never properly used in my daily life ever since.
I am sure I will find some time and motivation in the future to properly review those once I have had my break during the Holidays.
To strengthen this statement: I bought a vocabulary book to study for my second JLPT attempt in July 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that I have mentioned JLPT, allow me to explain shortly what it is. <a href="http://www.jlpt.jp/e/"><strong>JLPT</strong></a> is the abbreviation for Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It is an examination to, surprise surprise, measure your Japanese language proficiency and grants you a nice, official piece of paper stating your level when succeeded.
The examination is done twice per year and you can apply for one of the 5 available levels, starting on the bottom with N5 (the easiest) and ending with N1 (the toughest).
Last week, I took the N4 exam.
The content of my language course exceeds the border of the N5 level by dozens of miles, so I was ambitious to apply for the next level.
The only thing that is not really covered good by the course are Kanji, which were crucial for the vocabulary part of the exam.
For N4, you should know around 285 characters plus a ton of words you can spell with them.
Being to exhausted from daily school life, I only studied 120 Kanji (enough for N5).
Hence, the exam went as I had expected: I had enough knowledge for the grammar part, listening went rather easy, but I simply don&#8217;t know enough Kanjis for the vocabulary part.
Since that part went rather bad, I doubt I will pass the exam, but I will get my official result at the end of January.
I still have the examination moment in July, for which I will have more time to prepare properly, but being ambitious as always, I will try to achieve the N3 level!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If people start to think all of sudden I have had no life outside of my language studies, don&#8217;t worry!
On Friday nights I visited the local izakayas in my ward with Sa≈°o, Ole and other friends I made during my volounteer classes at Musashi Kosugi station and got in touch with some local folks over there.
It&#8217;s a great way to practise some casualy spoken Japanese.
I also went to the <a href="http://fes16.moshimoshi-nippon.jp/en/"><strong>Moshi Moshi Nippon Festival 2016</strong></a>.
It&#8217;s a festival promoting Japan&#8217;s teen and pop culture.
A nice thing about the festival is that it was free for gaikokujin (Â§ñÂõΩ‰∫∫, foreigner), or for short gaijin, but you had to register to get inside the venue.
The festival was held in Tokyo Taiikakun, at the border of Shinjuku and Shibuya.
Outside the building, there was an free-entry zone with food stands and an outdoor stage.
Drinks were very cheap when compared to Belgian festivals.
Inside, you had various booths and 2 stages with various performances.
Despite having great names in the line up, the number of people attending the event was rather small.
The event site itself was also smaller than I had expected and the booths were mostly focused on the female products like make-up and girl-magazines.
There was a Resident Evil booth though where you could play a demo of the soon releasing new game with Playstation VR, but I couldn&#8217;t fetch a ticket unfortunately.
I wouldn&#8217;t spend my whole weekend there, but I certainly had a lot of fun for one full afternoon.
I expected an overcrowded site, but this wasn&#8217;t absolutely the case.</p>

<p>What I really looked forward to was the performance of <strong>BAND-MAID</strong>.
The timetable seemed to have a 10-minute block for the band, but the gig almost took 25 minutes.
I only know the band for a short period, but really fell in love with some of their songs.
Their performance blew me away.
I was certainly satisfied and glad I had seen them performing live.
Their genre ranges from hard rock to heavy metal but some elements make the band stand out.
First of all, all the band members are girls, which I have rarely encountered until now.
But what draws the most attention are their maid dresses.
People who are familiar with maid caf√©'s will recognise where the inspiration came from.
Two band members happen to be former maids in one of the countless maid caf√©'s in Akihabara.
During the gig, one of the two vocalists did the well known 'moe moe kyun' scene with us.
I found a video starting from the 'moe moe kyun' moment and the second part of their performance.
Due to the volume, the recording doesn&#8217;t sound great, but it gives you a good idea of how the band looks like.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 2. The best picture I could take of the BAND-MAID performance</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Outside the venue, I saw a performance of <strong>Niji no Conquistador</strong>, an idol group with quite young girls. I haven&#8217;t checked their actual ages, but I had the impression they were around 14 to 16.
Their fanclub was clearly present in the crowd, throwing in all their screams, jumps, even one guy stood (litterly standing on his feet straight up) on top of another guy cheering for the idols.
Really funny and impressive to see how these fanatic fans give the fullest of themselves during the performance.
I ended the festival with the performance of <strong>Silent Siren</strong>, another all-female band in a more pop rock style of music.
It was also a really amazing performance!
In front of me there was another genki fanatic cheerer who almost broke the camera of his neighbour when he was throwing his fist in the air and jumping around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During November, I also had some cultural events at/with school.
On an afternoon, there was a calligraphy session.
I tried at least 20 times to draw the Kanji for heart (ÂøÉ, kokoro), but it didn&#8217;t turn out the way I wanted to.
I blame the brush!
It was way more difficult then I thought to draw the strokes the way they should be.
It demands a lot of attention and patience, which I didn&#8217;t have that day for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>In the same week, we also had a school trip to the <a href="http://tatemonoen.jp/english/"><strong>Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum</strong></a>.
Belgian folks can compare this museum to Bokrijk.
The museum consists of old buildings, like houses, shops, farms etc. from the Edo period.
There was even an old style onsen.
The visit was finished by a traditional Japanese tea ceremony (Ëå∂ÈÅì, saado).
The day before the ceremony, we learned the proper etiquette during the ceremony.
Being scared to forget some of the steps of the ceremony, I was really nervous, since I didn&#8217;t want to ruin the ceremony by making any mistake.
Next to this, the blood circulation in my legs decided to give up after sitting quite a long time on my knees, which became really painful.
But in the end, it was a nice experience.
To finally end this blog, I share with you the small number of pictures I have from the Museum and the tea ceremony.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s tell a bit about the places I have visited! I have walked through several parks in  Tokyo, made a stop at the Pok√©mon Center in Ikebukoro and wandered around in Akihabara drooling on all the anime merchandise I saw over there! That&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg of what I have done, but I still need to explore a lot of Tokyo. I guess I will get the opportunity to do this during the Christmas break. Last month I even left Tokyo to visit the beatiful city Kamakura (ÈéåÂÄâ) with 3 other Vulcanus trainees. The city is only 50 kilometers south from Tokyo and has a long history, which makes it an attractive spot for tourists.
What can you expect to find in Kamakura? Well, it&#8217;s very simple: religious spots, tons and tons of them. The city is surrounded by Shinto shrines (Á•ûÁ§æÔºö„Åò„Çì„Åò„ÇÉ; jinja) and Buddhist temples („ÅäÂØ∫Ôºö„Åä„Å¶„Çâ; otera). Some of them were built centuries ago and still remain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We made a nice roundtrip around the city and witnessed a rather green village without skyscapers, which really contrasts with the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. I felt a bit relieved actually to be out of the big city for a bit. Since it is way more interesting to see for yourself where I have been, I decided to make this post more interactive by adding a map of my roundtrip. We had a nice walk of around 10km, starting from Kamakura station and ending at Kita-Kamakura station. Of course, I also took some pictures. I&#8217;m not going to waste a lot of words in this post and let the map and pictures speak for themselves: <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/G2qetVywN4awRXzq5"><strong>ALBUM</strong></a></p>

<p>Our first stop was the village&#8217;s most famous attraction: the great Buddha Statue, a.k.a Daibutsu (Â§ß‰ªè, Big Buddha). It&#8217;s a 13,35 meters high sitting Buddha made out of bronze and was built in the 13th century! It&#8217;s set in the middle of a Buddhist temple and it is even possible to enter the insides of the statues.</p>

<p>Our second stop was Hase-dera, another Buddhist Temple, built on the side of a steep hill. It is a big temple with a lot of beautiful things that turn you speechless! You can climb a lot of stairs, which grants you a nice overview over the city. You can see eagles circling around Kamakura and see the nearby beach.</p>

<p>After that we went for the Gyonyama Hiking Trail over one of the mountains surrounding Kamakura. There was a nice lookout point on the route, giving you a nice view of the village from the west side. The trail brought us to the biggest Shinto shrine of Kamakura: Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g≈´, where I was pleased to witness a Shinto wedding ceremony!</p>

<p>After the wedding, our journey continued through the main street for some food and then we walked all the way to Kita-Kamakura station to visit the Engaku-ji, a Buddhist Temple just besides the station. This was our final stop for this tiring but oh so satisfying trip.
I can only say I have enjoyed the day from beginning 'til the end and can only recommend people to visit the town for themselves and take the time to actually walk around! Most of the sites are close to train stations, but you will enjoy the green environment more by walking from one spot to another in my opinion.

<p>What have I been doing in Japan until now? Besides visiting some nice places and events like Akihabara, Yoyogi Park, Tokyo Game Show and Kamakura (the latter will be the topic of my next post), I&#8217;ve spent most of my time in Shibuya. Sidenote: I really recommend you to visit the <a href="https://vulcanus.stanovnik.net/"><strong>blog</strong></a> of my Slovene buddy, Sa≈°o, for some awesome pictures of Akihabara and other places he visited (which I mostly joined) Why Shibuya? I study in a private school over there: <a href="http://www.naganuma-school.ac.jp/"><strong>The Naganuma School - Tokyo School of Japanese Language</strong></a>. What could I possibly be studying over there? It&#8217;s not Computer Science I can tell you ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before heading to Japan, there was a Vulcanus meeting near the European headquarters of the EU-Japan Centre in Brussels. At the end of the meeting, we had a small test to measure the level of Japanese we already (might have) had. This was done to select the students who already have some Japanese knowledge and put these people into special courses which are more advanced. There was made an advanced class for those trainees, the Ëä± (Hana, flower) class. The Japanese language knowledge of two Vulcanus trainees is so advanced, they were allowed to follow a course on 'Business Japanese'!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve already had 7 weeks of classes. My Japanese language course will last until the mid of December. Especially for the Vulcanus students, the school took the effort to compress their initial language course to a 4-months schedule which normally takes 6-months! Of course, this means that we need to process a lot of content in less time than originally expected. This is hard for the students, but do not underestimate what this demands of the teachers too! They have to prepare their lessons faster than usual and have to be sure to stick to schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this course, we study the two „Åø„Çì„Å™„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨Ë™û (Minna no Nihongo: literally translates to 'everyone&#8217;s Japanese') Shokyu books, consisting of 25 chapters each, guided by a grammar book. We finished the first book last week and are currently at lesson 28 (third chapter of the second book). Apart from the books, we also have lessons where we focus on pronunciation, presentation practice and Kanji reading and writing. Kanji is the Chinese writing system that was adopted centuries ago by Japan. Most of the words you see in public life are therefore written using Kanji. Besides Kanji, there is another group of characters which are called Kana: the authentic Japanese writing system which was developed after Kanji. It consists of the 2 character sets „Å≤„Çâ„Åå„Å™ (Hiragana) and „Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éä (Katakana). These sets both have different purposes. The main distinction you can make between Hiragana and Katakana is that the former is used for conjugations and particles, whilst the latter is used to spell foreign words in a Japanese&#8217;yfied manner. Since I only know Kana and a very, very, VERY small number of Kanji at the moment (let&#8217;s pin it to a number of 30 for now), I can barely read anything in the streets, but little by little I&#8217;m making progress!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>From Monday to Friday, I commute to school. One trip from my apartment to school takes around 50 minutes and consists of approximately 2 kilometers of walking and traveling by train. This means I walk almost 4 kilometers on a daily basis, which is very good to maintain my health and weight! I currently have the goal to walk at least 8000 steps per day, which I easily manage to do now.
The 34 Vulcanus trainees are divided into smaller groups of 6 to 8 people. My class is called Êòü (Hoshi: Star) and I have two main teachers Ê∏°ÈÇâÂÖàÁîü„ÄÄ(Watanabe-sensei) on Mondays and Wednesdays and Êü¥Áî∞ÂÖàÁîü„ÄÄ(Shibata-sensei) on Thursday&#8217;s. What about Tuesdays and Fridays? Well, on those days the teachers switch from classrooms by shifting either clockwise or counterclockwise. So, in total I learn Japanese from 4 different teachers. This is in my opinion a good approach, because each teacher has her (all my teachers are women) own approach and style of teaching. Next to this, it allows us to improve our listening skills since we&#8217;re confronted with different voices. All the teachers are really kind and what really impresses me is the effort they put in each lesson. They try to make each topic as attractive as possible to the students by involving their personal preferences and experiences into each conversation. Besides teaching us Japanese, they also offer help when we had some troubles that don&#8217;t consider the language class. For instance, I received a notice from Leopalace about the alarm system of my apartment. I asked Watanabe-sensei for a small summary of what was written. It said the alarm system had to be upgraded and I had to make an appointment with the security company. Since my level of Japanese speech is still far from feeling comfortable to have phone conversations, I was really glad that Watanabe-sensei spontaneously offered to make the phone call herself.</p>

<p>School starts at 9 o&#8217;clock. We have school periods of 45 minutes, followed by a 10-minute-break. After 4 school periods we have lunch from 12:30 to 13:30. The number of school periods we have in the afternoon alters: normally we have 2 periods, but sometimes the final period is a private lesson for a subset of the class. It might also happen that we get an additional third school period in the afternoon, which is called 'Conversation Class'. In this class, we learn some typical vocabulary used in common situations (paying groceries, ordering food in a restaurant, booking train tickets, visiting the doctor&#8230;&#8203;). So school either ends at 14:15, 15:10 or 16:05, but in general it is 15:10. School is fun, but really intensive. I really need to stay focused all the time. Therefore I&#8217;m really longing for the breaks sometimes! A lot of vocabulary, verbs and grammatical structures are crammed daily into our heads, which is why you often have to revise the lessons in the evenings to keep up with the pace. You cannot afford yourself to run behind or you&#8217;ll start to dig a pit from which it is really hard to get out! The homework we get are mostly exercises on the previous lesson and studying new vocabulary for the upcoming lesson so that we can focus more on the new grammatical structures during the day. Below, I have added a video published by the school itself that summarises their teaching method. It takes around 40 minutes, but worth it! Be sure to put on the English subtitles! ;-)</p>

<p>What really makes my life at school complete are the two typical elements each school has in anime: the typical Japanese school bell jingle and a roof top where you can walk around, sit on a bench and have an occasional lunch break! The school bell is a very soothing sound, which is totally different from the harsh ring in the elementary and secondary school I had. The rooftop has a small view on the buildings around the school. It is really calm over there! The perfect place to come to rest during the brain melting Japanese studies!</p>

<p>In short: school is intensive but really a great experience. I still suck a bit at speaking spontaneously though, especially when I need to conjugate verbs. However, Sa≈°o found Japanese conversation classes near our station in Kawasaki! Last week, we joined these classes and meet twice a week to improve our natural speech. We were heartily welcomed from the beginning and were immediately invited to join the Tuesday&#8217;s group for a trip to Ikuta Park to have a picnic and visit the planetarium. This way we&#8217;ll try to truly master the Japanese language!</p>

<p>Being in Japan for already 40 days, I noticed a lot of stuff that makes my life pleasant. I&#8217;ll try to give a summary of some of the positive things I encountered so far. First, I also wanted to summarize the stuff I don&#8217;t like about Japan so far (and yes, there are some points you won&#8217;t like about any country), but I&#8217;ll keep that for another post, so stay tuned!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_public_transport">Public transport</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of you know the legends and fairy tales about perfect train systems on which the train never comes late: the tales are true, my friend! This is absolutely the greatest thing I have encountered so far. Being used to public transport in Belgium, especially busses, Japanese public transport is a relief! Trains arrive and leave ON TIME, and then I mean SPOT-ON! In Belgium, you have to be happy if your train only arrives 5 minutes late, which is still considered on time by the NMBS (the Belgian rail company).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I commute between the stations Musashi-Kosugi (near my apartment) and Shibuya (near to my school) and can choose between 4 different kinds of trains on my line: Local, Express, Limited Express and Commuter Express. Local trains („Åã„Åè„Åà„Åç„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åó„ÇÉ, kakuekiteisha) stop at every station on the line and hence are the slowest ones. Shibuya is the first station on the line and Musashi-Kosugi the eleventh, so 10 stops until I reach my destination, which takes about half an hour. The Express train skips 3 to 4 stations, but the fastest trains on the line are the Limited Express and Commuter Express trains. These only stop at the greater stations where you can transfer to another line. Now of course, everyone is keen on commuting quicker, which means that a lot of people prefer the Commuter Express, especially in the morning when people have to get to work or school in time. Result: whenever I tried to take the Commuter Express in the mornings, I was literally being a sardine in a can. (Could I get some lemon and salt with that?) So I prefer taking the local train instead, which will also be crowded in the mornings, but at least you can move your arms to catch your phone and read a newspaper. Commuting time doesn&#8217;t differ that much after all in my case. I guess I can gain only 10 minutes in the morning and since I leave pretty early to school, it doesn&#8217;t really matter to me. However, in the early afternoon (let&#8217;s say 15:00) the Commuter Express really gives a benefit. Then, it only takes me 10 to 12 minutes to commute between my stations and you can sit comfortably too since it isn&#8217;t that crowded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next to this, there are general habits in train stations that make life easier and bearable for everyone: queueing. <strong><em>What do you mean? People actually properly stand in lines to enter the train? Can people actually behave civilized?</em></strong> EXACTLY, no fighting to get in or out of the train, people properly wait until it is their turn to get in. And not only for entering the train! In huge stations, like Shibuya, you have thousands of people transferring and commuting. Therefore, a dozen of train lines enter this station, making it a huge maze, with several floors. Having so much floors in your station means you definitely have to use escalators to get around. In Japan, there is the nice habit to keep one half of the escalator free for people who are in a hurry and therefore want to walk/run on the escalators. Of course, before you get on the escalator, you queue properly in the correct line: the line for people that run on the escalators, or the line for people that stand still on the escalator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then finally the last but certainly not the least thing I like about Japanese public transport: navigation. Having huge stations means you can easily get lost. However, the signs come to a help. The stations are filled with them. And luckily: all these signs have English translations! As a foreigner this is really a relief.  You simply follow the arrows to the line or exit you want to reach and done.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_general_kindness">General kindness</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever you enter a store, you will be greeted by most of the staff. Their smiles and bows bring you in a really happy mood. But this kindness is not only present in stores, in the stations you have the common habit not to bother each other on the trains and queue properly for escalators and entering the train wagon. Japan has a huge population, especially in Tokyo, so you have to cope with the fact that there are a lot of people around you. When you want to feel at ease, you should ensure that you let others feel at ease. The best way to deal with each other is being calm and polite. But of course, this has to come from both sides! Don&#8217;t be rude, nor stare at people! Offer your seat for the elderly! Don&#8217;t, but really, DON&#8217;T play music aloud on the train! There are headsets, so use them! Turn the ringtone of your mobile phone off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People also help you whenever you ask them to! Let me give you an anecdote to illustrate this: last week, I was at a „Åä„Åì„ÅÆ„Åø„ÇÑ„Åç (okonomiyaki) restaurant with the other Fujitsu boys and wanted to order a new dish that we hadn&#8217;t tried before: „ÇÇ„Çì„Åò„ÇÉ„ÇÑ„Åç (monjayaki). Normally, you grill/cook the dish yourself at your table, but we had no clue how to do this properly since it wasn&#8217;t exactly the same as the okonomiyaki we were used to. So we asked the waiter how to do this and he grilled it for us! He really took effort in showing it to us instead of just explaining it briefly, which I really appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="_public_bathrooms_are_free_clean">Public bathrooms are free &amp; CLEAN</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Belgium, you easily pay 50 cents of 'maintenance fee' to use a public toilet and from time to time these bathrooms have a rather 'used' impression. But people in Japan have a better understanding of general hygiene in my opinion and leave the toilets behind in the way they want to encounter them: clean. So no need to pay a toilet lady that has to supervise the bathroom continuously and clean the place. Of course these toilets get properly cleaned, but at least in Japan the staff does not have to be present all the time to check whether you aim correctly or not.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>„Ç≥„É≥„Éì„Éã (konbini, short for convenience store) are everywhere. For the Belgian reader, you can compare these shops to Carrefour Express or City Delhaize. Just across my apartment, there is a 7-Eleven, where I can buy warm bento&#8217;s whenever I don&#8217;t want to go out for dinner (At the moment I don&#8217;t cook myself but I&#8217;m planning to!). Next to this, these stores are 24/7 open! How „Åπ„Çì„Çä„ÄÄ(benri: convenient) is that? The prices are bit more expensive than in the supermarket, but people gladly pay a bit more for the convenience. Next to buying food, I can also withdraw cash from the ATM over there.</p>

<h2 id="_food_establishments_at_fair_prices">Food establishments at fair prices</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s no need to cook for yourself if you don&#8217;t want to. There are tons of places you can go to have lunch or dinner. Going out for food is quite common here, and therefore it doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive at all! You&#8217;d guess of course you can only get junk food at low prices but less is true. You have a lot of simple dishes that can be bought that aren&#8217;t that fat. The greatest example might be „É©„Éº„É°„É≥ (raamen: noodle soup) which is cheap and you feel satisfied and full after one bowl. As a person who has always struggled with his weight, I can say that I managed to keep my weight stable until now!</p>

<p>In Europe we have a similar thing, a 1 euro store, but what you often find in such stores is mostly rubbish. However in a ÁôæÂÜÜ„Çπ„Éà„Ç¢„Éº (hyaku-en stoa, 100 yen store) you find a lot of simple necessities that make your daily life easier: chopsticks, cups, glasses, plates, knifes, paper, pencils&#8230;&#8203; you find a lot of stuff at very low prices. Most of the stuff costs 100 yen (which is currently around 86 eurocents if I recall correctly), but whenever it is more expensive, it is notified on the product. However, don&#8217;t forget you pay 8% of taxes on your products, so you actually pay 108 yen for the product if it&#8217;s labeled to be 100 yen!</p>

<p>Ever considered eating chips with honey? Or what did you think of mayonnaise on your omelet? Ketchup on your rice?! For me, it sounded really strange and disgusting, but I was wrong. Being in a new country means you will get to know new types of food and habits that you&#8217;re not used to, which is why I was really surprised by some food combinations they make in Japan, but certainly in a positive way. It&#8217;s really good! Ever considered pouring warm egg yolk (the yellow part of an egg) over your rice? You should give it a try!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s quite late in comparison to Belgium, where the supermarkets close at 20:00 (except for 21:00 on Fridays). And you know what&#8217;s even better? The hour before they close, they give discounts to all the fresh food that&#8217;s still available and otherwise has to be thrown away! Also the supermarkets are open every day, even on Sundays! I weekly visit the supermarket before closing time to buy some milk, cereal and some other drinks in big bottles. But I also check whether there is a bento or some other dish that I can take along as late night dinner at 50% of the price.</p>

<p>I know it has been a while since my previous post. My apologies for my procrastination: „Åî„ÇÅ„Çì„Å≠ (gomenne: my apologies)! It&#8217;s already been a month since I touched Japanese soil for the first time, unimaginable! Time flies, it feels as if I&#8217;ve been here only 2 weeks. Anyway, I&#8217;ll finally tell some stuff that some people have been asking me for, so here we go! Let&#8217;s talk about the "struggles" I encountered in order to ensure my journey to Japan and the measures I had to take during my first days in the country in order to settle myself in the country.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_before_departure">Before departure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the 30th of August, I left my home country to live for a whole year in Japan for the Vulcanus in Japan exchange program. Due to the duration of the program, I couldn&#8217;t simply book my flight and jump on the plane. Some paperwork had to be done before even considering booking my flight. I am obviously talking about getting a visa. As a Belgian tourist, you don&#8217;t need to do this as long as you can prove to the Japanese immigration officer at the airport that you leave Japan within 3 months, by showing your return flight ticket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to get a visa, you first of all have to get an international passport (or travel passport, whichever one sounds good for you). This is mostly acquired by queueing a long time at your town&#8217;s civil affairs department. In Belgium, you pay a minimum of ‚Ç¨64 for a 32-page booklet, exclusive taxes. The taxes you pay depend on the city you live in. I had the luck to live in the city with the second most expensive city taxes of Belgium, hoozaah! In total, I had to pay the generous sum of ‚Ç¨100 to get that passport set and done.
When finally acquired your passport, you&#8217;re ready to get that visa right? Well, you can sprint to the Japanese embassee in your country and apply for a visa, but the procedure will take months and the chances of being approved are low, unless you take a detour. That detour is acquiring a Certificate of Eligibility (COE for short). The COE is a document handed out by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to approve your long visit to Japan. I won&#8217;t go into details on how you fill in the application form, but most important in order to get such a COE is having contacts in Japan.  For students, this is often the university where they will study and for employees this is often the company that hired them.„ÄÄIn my case, the contact was the EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation that organises the exchange program. I received my COE during the Vulcanus Preparatory Meeting in Brussels on the 7th of July.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With your passport and COE in your hands, you&#8217;re finally ready to hop to the Japanese embasee and apply for a visa! The procedure took around a week and the result was a beautiful sticker in my passport that grants me entry to the Land of the Rising Sun, the glorious Êó•Êú¨ (Nihon/Nippon: Japan). The purpose of my visa mentions "cultural activities", since the exchange program I undergo is not related to an educational institute, nor am I an employee at a particular country, which means I didn&#8217;t get a student visa nor a trainee visa. I&#8217;m a mixture of both in some way.</p>

<p>For my flight, I chose to leave from Schiphol, the international airport of The Netherlands. During the period I wanted to book my flight, there were regular strikes and delays at the Belgian airport due to the recent terrorist attacks. Therefore, I wanted to choose an airport with more stability. Gautier, the lone French Vulcanus trainee who had an intership in Amsterdam back then, was also planning to leave from Schiphol. Therefore we booked tickets for the same flight and reserved seats next to each other. The day of the flight was one full of nerves and excitement. I checked my luggage 3 times, just to be sure I would take everything I&#8217;d need with me! I arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure, so I could go tranquilly to my gate without any issues. The plane I was going to board was already waiting for me.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, Gautier and I flew to Qatar, where we had to transfer for our flight to Narita International Airport. In Qatar, we had to sprint since we only had an hour of transfer time and we needed to go through security checks a second time and queuing took a while. We got on time in our plane, so the real trip to Japan could start! I slept a couple of hours in this plane, so the 10-hour trip didn&#8217;t feel this long luckily! When I woke up we were already flying over China. Two hours later, we were flying over Japanese soil. With a setting sun at the horizon, I was welcomed by Mount Fuji during the landing. This was for me a sign of the start of an incredible experience!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After being landed in Narita Airport, I had to queue for passport control. During queuing I got an officer asking me the duration of my stay. The officer guided me out of the queue to some seats to wait a bit. Since I stay for more than 3 months, I had to receive a Residence Card. This card is the ID-card for foreigners who reside in Japan. This took a while and then I had a small interview with an immigration inspector and got my face photographed and fingerprints scanned, which is part of the standard procedure.</p>

<h3 id="_register_your_address_and_apply_for_national_health_insurance">Register your address and apply for National Health Insurance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first night, I stayed in a hotel together with the other Vulcanus trainees. We got our orientation day the next morning. The Japanese weather was unforgiving: a frying 34¬∞C and a humidity level of imeasurable values. Drenched in sweat I arrived at the Europa house, where the orientation took place. After the presentation, I had to wait for a representative of Fujitsu to pick up the students that will have their internship at Fujitsu Laboratories in Kawasaki.  In total we are 3: Sa≈°o, from Slovenia; Ole from Germany and then there&#8217;s that Belgian guy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The representative brought us, after a great lunch in the most Japanese place you can imagine (read: McDonald&#8217;s), to the city hall in the Nakahara ward, where we had to register the address where we will live and had to apply for National Health Insurance. I must say this was the first time I was confronted by the known fact that nobody in Japan speaks English. The documents for address registration and insurance application were completely written in Japanese, nor could anyone of the staff assist us in English. Luckily, the Fujitsu representative stayed with us the whole afternoon to complete the forms with us. The National Health Insurance is mandatory for residents that stay at least a year in Japan. Since we only stay in Japan for a bit less than a year, the staff at the city hall wasn&#8217;t convinced we were obliged to apply for the insurance, but since we had strict orders of the EU-Japan Centre, we insisted on it and received our health insurance card. After the arrangements in the city hall were done, we had a small visit to the company where we received our appartment keys and were each guided to our appartments. Normally, we were supposed to live in the dormitory of Fujitsu, but there happened to be no vacancy left, so Fujitsu booked 3 small appartments for us. The 3 of us live apart in Leopalace21 appartments. The appartments are a small 5-minute walk from each other, so we can easily hang out together. The appartment offers more benefits for us than the dorm would have done: we all have a full private accomodation now and we can invite some visitors. Bonus!!</p>

<h3 id="_get_a_bank_account">Get a bank account</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, Friday the 2nd of September, the 3 Fujitsu guys went to Shibuya to get a bank account. We chose to go to Shinsei Bank, since they are one of the only banks that offer English services (as already mentioned, you easily get confronted with language barriers when it comes to particular domestic services). We went to the Shibuya office, but got kicked out. We were advised to go to the Head office near Tokyo Station, half an hour from Shibuya, because this office wasn&#8217;t familiar with dealing with a lot of foreigners at the same time. This was because there were already 2 Vulcanus trainees inside. The Head Office could handle us better&#8230;&#8203;</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we planned to go to the other office but had to do it the next week since we didn&#8217;t have anymore time that day, because a second orientation presentation was going to be held in the afternoon by the EU-Japan Centre and afterwards we were invited to a reception in the Sheraton Hotel where we had the honor to meet the principle and some members of the teaching staff from the Naganuma school. The ambassadors from some European countries and representatives from the different companies that participated in the Vulcanus program were also present. I had the opportunity to meet my supervisor for the internship, but the Belgian ambassador sent his regards. It was a very pleasant event nevertheless!</p>

<h3 id="_get_a_sim_card">Get a SIM-card</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first weekend, the 3 Fujitsu guys went to Shibuya again and entered a BIC CAMERA shop to get a Japanese SIM card. There are a lot of possibilities of SIM cards and plans to acquire depending on the duration of your stay and the amount of mobile data you want to consume. You can also choose whether you want a data-only SIM or would like to be able to text and make phone calls. The choice is up to you! A nice summary of the available SIM cards can be found on <a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/prepaid-cheap-japan-sim-card-options/">Tokyo Cheapo</a> for short and long stays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I stay a whole year in Japan, I chose a BIC SIM, with 3GB data per month including a phone number. Besides the initial activation costs, this will cost me 1600yen per month. Note that phone calls and text messages are excluded from this fee. So the price for the phone call you make and the numbers of texts you send will be added to this price! It is still cheap when compared to Belgium as long as you do as much as possible over mobile data which is currently possible with VOIP (Voice Over IP) and Messaging Services of Social Media.</p>

<h3 id="_commuter_pass">Commuter pass</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From September until December, I will travel 5 days a week to the Naganuma School to learn Japanese. In order to ease my commuting with public transport, I bought a PASMO card. It&#8217;s an IC card that allows you to charge money on it which you can use to travel around using public transport including trains, metro and buses. It is a must-have if you want to travel using public transport in a comfortable way. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to buy tickets at a counter everytime and this can become complicated if you need to transfer onto lines that are from another company. IC cards work on all the lines. There exist several types of cards and normally it doesn&#8217;t really matter which one you buy, <strong>UNLESS</strong> you want to charge a commuter pass on it. A commuter pass is a fee you pay to travel between 2 stations on a more regular basis. Therefore, it does matter which IC card you buy, because you are obliged to travel through at least one station of the company from which you bought the IC card. Therefore I had to get a PASMO card specifically, because I can travel to the school using the Tokyu Toyoko Line, which is owned by the Tokyu Coorporation. However, in the airport I bought another IC card, Suica. This card is offered by JR, a train company. Since I do not need to travel using a JR line, I was obliged to get the other IC card. Luckily, I can get a refund on my Suica if I return it to one of the JR stations, but for now I decided to keep it since it is a pretty card with a cute penguin on it. The commuter pass is valid for a month or 3 months. For my own safety I bought a 1-month commuter passes in case I might lose my PASMO card.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leopalace21 provides its own Internet sevice to their appartments, which is called LEONET.
I simply had to make an account, pay for one month and all set and done: enjoy that unlimited downloading you&#8217;re used to! Only problem: the instructions were Japanese&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a couple of days trying to translate the instructions, the 3 Fujitsu guys figured out how to get stuff done and then we finally had Internet available in our appartments!
This was the final point on my bucket list to get done during the first weeks in Japan.
Now I can enjoy a comfortable life in my appartment with WiFi, travel easily to school or other destinations using public transport and get my scholarship to spend money!</p>

<p>After being already 10 days in Japan, I finally have found the opportunity to write my first post. We will start at the beginning, which is the reason why I left to Japan. Most of you know this already, but for the people that don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll try to give a quick summary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During my first year of my Master&#8217;s program, I was already thinking about what I could do afterwards. Normally, one starts looking for a job or continues his/her studies with an additional Master&#8217;s program or PhD. I chose I could go for a PhD, since I would love to perform research in my further career and getting a PhD is in my opinion the right way to get into R&amp;D later on. However, having not that much practical experience in Computer Science, I wanted to gain some before starting a career.  That&#8217;s why I was planning to do an intern- or traineeship somewhere during summer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As most of you know, I am also a big fan of Japan. I love watching anime, but besides the wacko entertainment the Japanese provide, I also appreciate their ancient culture. I practice Jiu-Jitsu and I&#8217;d love to learn Kendo one day. I admire their spirit for perfectionism and their attitude to put collective harmony above personal benefit. Japan has been a source of inspiration since my childhood. That&#8217;s why I always was looking forward to visit the country one day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Around November 2014, I received an e-mail from my faculty. It was forwarded publicity from our university&#8217;s International Relationships Office. I quickly skimmed the email and noticed it told about an international exchange program, Vulcanus, for scientists and engineers. You would get the opportunity to work in the research department of a multinational. This sounded very interesting, since I wanted to do an internship and on top of that, it concerned research. However, the fact that the internship would be international scared me a bit. Nevertheless, I read the email a second time, a bit more thoroughly and that&#8217;s when it happened. I discovered you would get a 4-month language course and afterwards start your 8-month traineeship in&#8230;&#8203; Japan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A whole year in the land of my dreams, gaining some practical experience in a research department and learn Japanese as a surplus. This email came like some revelation at that moment.  It combined all the topics that I was wondering about around that period. I decided to apply for this exchange program in my graduation year. This program lasts a whole year, which is why I wanted to finish my studies first. After filling in some forms, writing a CV and motivation letter, gathering documents from my university and an acknowledgement from my doctor that I&#8217;m in a proper condition to travel abroad, I had put everything together to apply for the <a href="http://www.eu-japan.eu/events/vulcanus-japan">Vulcanus in Japan</a> program, although without that much hope to succeed. It is an exchange program on European level, so I was convinced I wouldn&#8217;t be able to compete with the other applicants during the selection procedures. However, in February 2016 I got the verdict: I was selected to go to Japan. The committee that had selected me, recommended a particular traineeship at <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/jp/group/labs/en/">Fujitsu Laboratories</a>. I had to write a motivation letter to the company and if I happened to be chosen by the company, I was ready to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you all know by now, Fujitsu Laboratories selected me for one of their internships and I am currently residing in Nakahara, Kawasaki City, in the Kanagawa prefecture, just outside of Tokyo. From September to December, I will daily commute to Shibuya, Tokyo to study Japanese at <a href="http://www.naganuma-school.ac.jp/">The Naganuma School, Tokyo School of Japanese Language</a>, together with the other 33 Vulcanus trainees. In my next post, I will talk more in detail about my flight and my first days in Japan.</p>
