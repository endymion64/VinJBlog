<p>I know it&#8217;s been a while since my previous post. My apologies for my procrastination: ごめんね (gomenne: my apologies)! It&#8217;s already been a month since I touched Japanese soil for the first time, unimaginable! Time flies, it feels as if I&#8217;ve been here only 2 weeks. Anyway, I&#8217;ll finally tell some stuff that some people have been asking me for, so here we go! Let&#8217;s talk about the "struggles" I encountered in order to ensure my journey to Japan and the measures I had to take during my first days in the country in order to settle myself in the country.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_before_departure">Before departure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the 30th of August, I left my home country to live for a whole year in Japan for the Vulcanus in Japan exchange program. Due to the duration of the program, I couldn&#8217;t simply book my flight and jump on the plane. Some paper work had to be done before even considering booking my flight. I am obviously talking about getting a visa. As a Belgian tourist, you don&#8217;t need to do this as long as you can proof to the Japanese immigration officer at the airport that you leave Japan within 3 months, by showing your return flight ticket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to get a visa, you first of all have to get an international passport (or travel passport, whichever one sounds good for you). This is mostly acquired by queueing a long time at your town&#8217;s civil affairs department. In Belgium, you pay a minimum of €64 for a 32-page booklet, exclusive taxes. The taxes you pay depend on the city you live in. I had the luck to live in the city with the second most expensive city taxes of Belgium, hoozaah! In total, I had to pay the generous sum of €100 to get that passport set and done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When finally acquired your passport, you&#8217;re ready to get that visa right? Well, you can sprint to the Japanese embassee in your country and apply for a visa, but the procedure will take months and the chances of being approved are low, unless you take a detour. That detour is acquiring a Certificate of Eligibility (COE for short). The COE is a document handed out by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to approve your long visit to Japan. I won&#8217;t go into details on how you fill in the application form, but most important in order to get such a COE is having contacts in Japan.  For students, this is often the university where they will study and for employees this is often the company that hired them.　In my case, the contact was the EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation that organises the exchange program. I received my COE during the Vulcanus Preparatory Meeting in Brussels on the 7th of July.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With your passport and COE in your hands, you&#8217;re finally ready to hop to the Japanese embasee and apply for a visa! The procedure took around a week and the result was a beautiful sticker in my passport that grants me entry to the Land of the Rising Sun, the glorious 日本 (Nihon/Nippon: Japan). The purpose of my visa mentions "cultural activities", since the exchange program I undergo is not related to an educational institute, nor am I an employee at a particular country, which means I didn&#8217;t get a student visa nor a trainee visa. I&#8217;m a mixture of both in some way.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For my flight, I chose to leave from Schiphol, the international airport of The Netherlands. During the period I wanted to book my flight, there were regular strikes and delays at the Belgian airport due to the recent terrorist attacks. Therefore, I wanted to choose an airport with more stability. Gautier, the lone French Vulcanus trainee who had an intership in Amsterdam back then, was also planning to leave from Schiphol. Therefore we booked tickets for the same flight and reserved seats next to each other. The day of the flight was one full of nerves and excitement. I checked my luggage 3 times, just to be sure I would take everything I&#8217;d need with me! I arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure, so I could go tranquilly to my gate without any issues. The plane I was going to board was already waiting for me.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 2. This plane brought me to Qatar</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, Gautier and I flew to Qatar, where we had to transfer for our flight to Narita International Airport. In Qatar, we had to sprint since we only had an hour of transfer time and we needed to go through security checks a second time and queuing took a while. We got on time in our plane, so the real trip to Japan could start! I slept a couple of hours in this plane, so the 10-hour trip didn&#8217;t feel this long luckily! When I woke up we were already flying over China. Two hours later, we were flying over Japanese soil. With a setting sun at the horizon, I was welcomed by Mount Fuji during the landing. This was for me a sign of the start of an incredible experience!</p>

<h3 id="_get_a_residence_card">Get a Residence Card</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After being landed in Narita Airport, I had to queue for passport control. During queuing I got an officer asking me the duration of my stay. The officer guided me out of the queue to some seats to wait a bit. Since I stay for more than 3 months, I had to receive a Residence Card. This card is the ID-card for foreigners who reside in Japan. This took a while and then I had a small interview with an immigration inspector and got my face photographed and fingerprints scanned, which is part of the standard procedure.</p>

<h3 id="_register_your_address_and_apply_for_national_health_insurance">Register your address and apply for National Health Insurance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first night, I stayed in a hotel together with the other Vulcanus trainees. We got our orientation day the next morning. The Japanese weather was unforgiving: a frying 34°C and a humidity level of imeasurable values. Drenched in sweat I arrived at the Europa house, where the orientation took place. After the presentation, I had to wait for a representative of Fujitsu to pick up the students that will have their internship at Fujitsu Laboratories in Kawasaki.  In total we are 3: Sašo, from Slovenia; Ole from Germany and then there&#8217;s that Belgian guy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The representative brought us, after a great lunch in the most Japanese place you can imagine (read: McDonald&#8217;s), to the city hall in the Nakahara ward, where we had to register the address where we will live and had to apply for National Health Insurance. I must say this was the first time I was confronted by the known fact that nobody in Japan speaks English. The documents for address registration and insurance application were completely written in Japanese, nor could anyone of the staff assist us in English. Luckily, the Fujitsu representative stayed with us the whole afternoon to complete the forms with us. The National Health Insurance is mandatory for residents that stay at least a year in Japan. Since we only stay in Japan for a bit less than a year, the staff at the city hall wasn&#8217;t convinced we were obliged to apply for the insurance, but since we had strict orders of the EU-Japan Centre, we insisted on it and received our health insurance card. After the arrangements in the city hall were done, we had a small visit to the company where we received our appartment keys and were each guided to our appartments. Normally, we were supposed to live in the dormitory of Fujitsu, but there happened to be no vacancy left, so Fujitsu booked 3 small appartments for us. The 3 of us live apart in Leopalace21 appartments. The appartments are a small 5-minute walk from each other, so we can easily hang out together. The appartment offers more benefits for us than the dorm would have done: we all have a full private accomodation now and we can invite some visitors. Bonus!!</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_get_a_bank_account">Get a bank account</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next day, Friday the 2nd of September, the 3 Fujitsu guys went to Shibuya to get a bank account. We chose to go to Shinsei Bank, since they are one of the only banks that offer English services (as already mentioned, you easily get confronted with language barriers when it comes to particular domestic services). We went to the Shibuya office, but got kicked out. We were advised to go to the Head office near Tokyo Station, half an hour from Shibuya, because this office wasn&#8217;t familiar with dealing with a lot of foreigners at the same time. This was because there were already 2 Vulcanus trainees inside. The Head Office could handle us better&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="admonitionblock warning">

<td class="content">
<strong>Do not go in groups to a Japanese bank because the staff is not used to it and they will kick you out!</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we planned to go to the other office but had to do it the next week since we didn&#8217;t have anymore time that day, because a second orientation presentation was going to be held in the afternoon by the EU-Japan Centre and afterwards we were invited to a reception in the Sheraton Hotel where we had the honor to meet the principle and some members of the teaching staff from the Naganuma school. The ambassadors from some European countries and representatives from the different companies that participated in the Vulcanus program were also present. I had the opportunity to meet my supervisor for the internship, but the Belgian ambassador sent his regards. It was a very pleasant event nevertheless!</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_get_a_sim_card">Get a SIM-card</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first weekend, the 3 Fujitsu guys went to Shibuya again and entered a BIC CAMERA shop to get a Japanese SIM card. There are a lot of possibilities of SIM cards and plans to acquire depending on the duration of your stay and the amount of mobile data you want to consume. You can also choose whether you want a data-only SIM or would like to be able to text and make phone calls. The choice is up to you! A nice summary of the available SIM cards can be found on <a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/prepaid-cheap-japan-sim-card-options/">Tokyo Cheapo</a> for short and long stays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I stay a whole year in Japan, I chose a BIC SIM, with 3GB data per month including a phone number. Besides the initial activation costs, this will cost me 1600yen per month. Note that phone calls and text messages are excluded from this fee. So the price for the phone call you make and the numbers of texts you send will be added to this price! It is still cheap when compared to Belgium as long as you do as much as possible over mobile data which is currently possible with VOIP (Voice Over IP) and Messaging Services of Social Media.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_commuter_pass">Commuter pass</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From September until December, I will travel 5 days a week to the Naganuma School to learn Japanese. In order to ease my commuting with public transport, I bought a PASMO card. It&#8217;s an IC card that allows you to charge money on it which you can use to travel around using public transport including trains, metro and buses. It is a must-have if you want to travel using public transport in a comfortable way. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to buy tickets at a counter everytime and this can become complicated if you need to transfer onto lines that are from another company. IC cards work on all the lines. There exist several types of cards and normally it doesn&#8217;t really matter which one you buy, <strong>UNLESS</strong> you want to charge a commuter pass on it. A commuter pass is a fee you pay to travel between 2 stations on a more regular basis. Therefore, it does matter which IC card you buy, because you are obliged to travel through at least one station of the company from which you bought the IC card. Therefore I had to get a PASMO card specifically, because I can travel to the school using the Tokyu Toyoko Line, which is owned by the Tokyu Coorporation. However, in the airport I bought another IC card, Suica. This card is offered by JR, a train company. Since I do not need to travel using a JR line, I was obliged to get the other IC card. Luckily, I can get a refund on my Suica if I return it to one of the JR stations, but for now I decided to keep it since it is a pretty card with a cute penguin on it. The commuter pass is valid for a month or 3 months. For my own safety I bought a 1-month commuter passes in case I might lose my PASMO card.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_get_internet_in_your_room_so_that_you_can_write_long_blog_posts">Get Internet in your room, so that you can write long blog posts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Leopalace21 provides its own Internet sevice to their appartments, which is called LEONET.
I simply had to make an account, pay for one month and all set and done: enjoy that unlimited downloading you&#8217;re used to! Only problem: the instructions were Japanese&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a couple of days trying to translate the instructions, the 3 Fujitsu guys figured out how to get stuff done and then we finally had Internet available in our appartments!
This was the final point on my bucket list to get done during the first weeks in Japan.
Now I can enjoy a comfortable life in my appartment with WiFi, travel easily to school or other destinations using public transport and get my scholarship to spend money!</p>
