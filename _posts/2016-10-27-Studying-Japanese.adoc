= Studying Japanese

What have I been doing in Japan until now? Besides visiting some nice places　and events like Akihabara, Yoyogi Park, Tokyo Game Show and Kamakura (the latter will be the topic of my next post) I've spent most of my time in Shibuya. Sidenote: I really recommend you to visit the https://vulcanus.stanovnik.net/[*blog*] of my Slovene buddy, Sašo, for some awesome pictures of Akihabara and other places he visited (which I mostly joined) Why Shibuya? I study in a private school over there: http://www.naganuma-school.ac.jp/[*The Naganuma School - Tokyo School of Japanese Language*]. What could I possibly be studying over there? It's not Computer Science I can tell you ;)

Before heading to Japan, there was a Vulcanus meeting near the European headquarters of the EU-Japan Centre in Brussels. At the end of the meeting, we had a small test to measure the level of Japanese we already (might have) had. This was done to select the students with Japanese knowledge and put these people into special courses which are more advanced. There was made an advanced class for those trainees, the 華 (Hana, flower) class and the Japanese language knowledge of two Vulcanus trainees is so advanced, they were allowed to follow a course on 'Business Japanese'!

I've already had 7 weeks of classes. My Japanese language course will last until the mid of December. Especially for the Vulcanus students, the school took the effort to compress their initial language course to a 4-month schedule which differs from the general 6-month course they offer! Of course this means that we need to process a lot of content in less time than originally expected from students at the school. This is hard for the students, but do not underestimate what this demands of the teachers too! They have to prepare their lessons faster than usual and have to be sure to stick to schedule. 

In this course, we study the two みんなの日本語　(Minna no Nihongo: literally translates to 'everyone's Japanese') Shokyu books, consisting of 25 chapters each, guided by a grammar book. We finished the first book last week and are currently at lesson 28 (third chapter of the second book). Apart from the books, we also have lessons where we focus on pronunciation, presentation practice and Kanji reading and writing. Kanji is the Chinese writing system that was adopted centuries ago by Japan. Most of the words you see in public life are therefore written using Kanji. Besides Kanji, there is another group of characters which are called Kana: the authentic Japanese writing system which was developed after Kanji. It consists of the 2 character sets ひらがな (Hiragana) and カタカナ (Katakana). These sets both have different purposes. The main distinction you can make between Hiragana and Katakana is that the former is used for conjugations and particles, whilst the latter is used to spell foreign words in a Japanese'yfied manner. Since I only know Kana and a very, very, VERY small number of Kanji at the moment (let's pin it to a number of 30 for now), I can barely read anything in the streets, but little by little I'm making progress!

From Monday to Friday, I commute to school. One trip from my apartment to school takes around 50 minutes and consists of approximately 2 kilometers of walking and traveling by train. This means I walk almost 4 kilometers on a daily basis, which is very good to maintain my health and weight! I currently have the goal to walk at least 8000 steps per day, which I easily manage to do now.
The 34 Vulcanus trainees are divided into smaller groups of 6 to 8 people. My class is called 星 (Hoshi: Star) and I have two main teachers 渡邉先生　(Watanabe-sensei) on Mondays and Wednesdays and 柴田先生　(Shibata-sensei) on Thursday's. What about Tuesdays and Fridays? Well, on those days the teachers switch from classrooms by shifting either clockwise or counterclockwise. So, in total I learn Japanese from 4 different teachers. This is in my opinion a good approach, because each teacher has her (all my teachers are women) own approach and style of teaching. Next to this, it allows us to improve our listening skills since we're confronted with different voices. All the teachers are really kind and what really impresses me is the effort they put in each lesson. They try to make each topic as attractive as possible to the students by involving their personal preferences and experiences into each conversation. Besides teaching us Japanese, they also offer help when we had some troubles that don't consider the language class. For instance, I received a notice from Leopalace about the alarm system of my apartment. I asked Watanabe-sensei for a small summary of what was written. It said the alarm system had to be upgraded and I had to make an appointment with the security company. Since my level of Japanese speech is still far from feeling comfortable to have phone conversations, I was really glad that Watanabe-sensei spontaneously offered to make the phone call herself.

School starts at 9 o'clock. We have school periods of 45 minutes, followed by a 10-minute-break. After 4 school periods we have lunch from 12:30 to 13:30. The number of school periods we have in the afternoon alters: normally we have 2 periods, but sometimes the final period is a private lesson for a subset of the class. It might also happen that we get an additional third school period in the afternoon, which is called 'Conversation Class'. In this class, we learn some typical vocabulary used in common situations (paying groceries, ordering food in restaurant, booking train tickets, visiting the doctor...) So school either ends at 14:15, 15:10 or 16:05, but in general it is 15:10. School is fun, but really intensive. I really need to stay focused all the time. Therefore I'm really longing for the breaks sometimes! A lot of vocabulary, verbs and grammatical structures is crammed daily into our heads, which is why you often have to revise the lessons in the evenings to keep up with the pace. You cannot afford yourself to run behind or you'll start to dig a pit from which it is really hard to get out again! The homework we get is mostly making exercises on the previous lesson and studying new vocabulary for the upcoming lesson so that we can focus more on the new grammatical structures during the day. Below, I have added a video published by the school itself that summarises their teaching method. It's takes around 40 minutes! Be sure to put on the English subtitles! ;-)

What really makes my life at school complete are the two typical elements each school has in anime: the typical Japanese school bell jingle and a roof top where you can walk around, sit on a bench and have an occasional lunch break! The school bell is a very soothing sound, which is totally different from the harsh ring in the elementary and secondary school I had. The rooftop has a small view on the buildings around the school. It is really calm over there! The perfect place to come to rest during the brain melting Japanese studies!

In short: school is intensive but a really great experience. I still suck a bit at speaking spontaneously though, especially when I need to conjugate verbs. However, Sašo found a Japanese conversation classes near our station in Kawasaki! Last week, we joined these classes and meet twice a week to improve our natural speech. We were heartily welcomed from the beginning and were immediately invited to join the Tuesday's group to a trip to Ikuta Park for a picnic and a visit the planetarium. This way we'll try to truly master the Japanese language!
